### Testing

- [X] Implement comprehensive unit test suite with higher coverage
- [X] Add integration tests for end-to-end event flow
- [X] Create performance benchmarks for event processing
- [X] Implement stress tests for high-volume event scenarios

### Configuration

- [x] Refactor configuration system to use a more type-safe approach
- [ ] Add validation for configuration parameters
- [ ] Implement hot reloading of configuration
- [ ] Create configuration templates for common use cases

### Monitoring and Observability

- [ ] Implement metrics collection for event processing (throughput, latency)
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Enhance logging with structured logging format
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing for event flows

### Scalability and Performance

- [x] Optimize event queue implementations for higher throughput

### Code Quality

- [x] Fix SuppressWarnings usage (replace with proper type safety)
- [x] Address TODO comments in the codebase
- [x] Implement consistent naming conventions
- [x] Reduce code duplication in event handling logic

### API Improvements

- [x] Create a more fluent API for event subscription
